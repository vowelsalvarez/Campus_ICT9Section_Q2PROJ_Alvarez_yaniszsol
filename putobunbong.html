                        <p>- Procedure:
Prepare the Ingredients:

<p>Soak the Rice:

<p>Wash the glutinous rice thoroughly to remove excess starch.
Soak the rice in water for at least 8 hours or overnight. This helps soften the rice for steaming.
Prepare the Steaming Setup:

<p>After soaking the rice, drain it well.
Traditionally, puto bungbong is steamed using bamboo tubes, but if you don’t have bamboo tubes, you can use small cylindrical molds or a regular steaming rack.
If using bamboo tubes, rinse them well to remove any dirt, and then place them upright on a steamer rack. If using molds, lightly grease them.
Steam the Rice:

<p>Fill a large pot or steamer with water and bring it to a boil.
Place the soaked rice into the bamboo tubes or molds, filling them about 3/4 full. If desired, pour a little coconut milk and a pinch of salt on the rice for added flavor.
Steam the rice for about 20-30 minutes, or until it becomes firm and the rice turns a vibrant purple color. You can check by inserting a toothpick or fork, and it should come out clean.
Prepare the Toppings:

<p>While the rice is steaming, combine the shredded coconut and brown sugar in a small bowl. Set aside.
Melt the butter in a small pan or microwave.
Assemble and Serve:

<p>Once the puto bungbong is done, remove it from the steamer. If using bamboo tubes, carefully remove the rice cake from the tubes by gently tapping or pushing the rice out.
Place the steamed rice cakes on a serving platter.
Drizzle melted butter over the top of the rice cakes. Then, sprinkle the shredded coconut and sugar mixture generously on top.
Enjoy:

<p>Serve the Puto Bungbong warm as a delicious snack or dessert. It’s best enjoyed with hot tea or as part of a festive meal.</p>
